# Facebook Login

This is a simple HTML page that mimics the Facebook login page and collects user login credentials. It uses jQuery and AJAX to send the data to a server.

## Prerequisites
- jQuery library

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How it works
1. The user enters their email or phone number and password in the input fields.
2. When the form is submitted, an AJAX request is made to the server specified in the `url` parameter.
3. The email and password are sent as POST data to the server.
4. If the request is successful, the user is redirected to the actual Facebook login page.
5. If there is an error, it can be handled in the `error` function of the AJAX request.
